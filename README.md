## Origin
Code originally written by [Matt Goldman](https://github.com/matt-goldman) and [merged](https://github.com/lukencode/FluentEmail/pull/218) into FluentEmail repo. But it was not published to NuGet. Because we needed this implementation we created a separate repo, modified the code a bit and published it to NuGet.
